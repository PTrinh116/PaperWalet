# NT213.O21.ANTT
Our team has successfully developed six scenarios that attackers can use to bypass SSL pinning. These scenarios include:
- Bypass SSL MITM (Man-In-The-Middle): This method allows attackers to intercept and modify traffic between the application and the server, making it possible to exploit sensitive information.
- Bypass SSL Reverse Engineering: Utilizes reverse engineering techniques to understand and disable SSL pinning mechanisms within the application's source code.
- Bypass SSL Dynamic Binary Instrumentation: Leverages dynamic analysis tools to intervene and alter the application's behavior in real-time.
- Bypass SSL Hooking: Applies frameworks such as Frida to inject malicious code into the application's process to bypass SSL pinning checks.
- Bypass SSL through System Attack: Involves interfering with the SSL verification process within the application.
- Bypass SSL Patch APK: Involves modifying and recompiling the APK to disable the SSL pinning mechanism.
